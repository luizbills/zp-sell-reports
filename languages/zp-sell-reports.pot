"birth data. Be aware that erasing this data means that the customers for "
"these orders will not be able to get a copy of their previous astrology "
"reports from their account area. Erasing this data does not affect future "
"report orders. Future reports will still be visible immediately when a "
"customer pays. Future report orders will continue to have their birth data "
"saved, and those reports will be available to customers when logged in to "
"their account area."
